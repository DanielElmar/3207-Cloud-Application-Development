# 3207-Group-Coursework

In this coursework we will create a prototype for a cloud application.

For this coursework we will be Team F.

## Deliverable 1
> Contains peer reviews and elevator pitch

`peer_reviews.txt` and `elevator_pitch.txt`

## Main Deliverable
> Contains all code for the application and a report

### Source Code
All source code for the project, along with instructions, will be provided.

* Instructions and code must be clear enough to allow the application to be deployed and run on a fresh cloud setup.

### The Report
> Must be in `team_F.pdf` file and have font size of __12__ or higher and contain a link to the application.

The report will contain the following, on the corrosponding page:

* (Optional Cover Page)
1. Description of prototype functionality
1. List of tools and techniques used
1. Relevant statistics (e.g. lines of code written, plus an assessment of code taken from acknowledged external sources - provide a list giving sources)
1. Brief overview of design and implementation, including key design decisions
1. Critical evaluation of the prototype submitted
1. List of contributions (a bullet pointed summary of the contributions each person in the group has made)

### Demonstration
> Presentation should take 15 minutes (20 mins hard limit). With 15 more minutes for q&a
> Must contain a live demonstration of the working application connected to the remote service.

Main Points:

* Tell us about your concept/idea - why, what and how?
* Present towards a "prospective customer" and deliver a presentation on your proposal
* Make sure you are ready to provide a live demonstration of your prototype and walk us through what you have built and deployed
* Show off your cloud knowledge and skills - we want to know how you have made the best use of cloud technologies
* Be prepared for questions, both from us and from Future Worlds on all aspects of your project
